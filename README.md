# DuoFlashFront

![Duo](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/duolingo/images/b/be/Duo_2019.png/revision/latest?cb=20190307143704)

This is the front end of the improved [DuoTerminal App](https://github.com/normandy14/duoTerminal).

## Motivation

The previous [duoTerminal app](https://github.com/normandy14/duoTerminal) lacked a proper modern gui for use and navigation. Instead, it relies on the terminal for input and output. The interaction is like the following:

The new GUI with React is:

DuoFlash is created for the user that wants to supplement their language learning on the Duolingo platform with additional learning tools. Duolingo is a great learning tool, but its web/android/ios iterface is bulky. The user learns already encountered words on the Duolingo platform with flash cards

In addition, the duoTerminal project is archived because it was difficult to maintain because it was poorly written in some aspects. I document this in the previous project, [duoTerminal app](https://github.com/normandy14/duoTerminal)

# Getting Started with React App

This react app requires the backend to be running. Here is the [DuoFlash backend](https://github.com/normandy14/duoFlashBack). Follow Getting started to quickly set up.

The front end and back end runs local or runs on the cloud. The latter requites the developer to tweak the Axios (a node library for making http requests) Get/Post requests (easy for mid-level fullstack developer)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

By default, open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view production buil in the browser

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
